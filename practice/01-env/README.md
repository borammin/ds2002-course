# Getting started with Environments

Start up Codespaces:

1. On GitHub go to your forked repository, click the green **Code** button
2. Select the **Codespaces** tab
3. Click **Create codespace on main** (or select a branch)
4. GitHub will automatically detect and use the default devcontainer configuration
5. Wait for the codespace to initialize (this may take a few minutes)

## Know your system

Once your codespace is running, open the terminal and run these commands to learn about your system:

1. Check the hostname of your system:
   ```bash
   hostname
   ```
   
   The output should look similar to this:
   ```bash
   codespaces-57da94
   ```

2. Post the output in the class poll (url will be shared in class). 

**Congratulations! You are all set for the next class activities.**
